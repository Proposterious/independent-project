# Updates to Project to Satisfy Requirements

## Daily Updates

### April 8th, 2024

Initialize project repository and move, update [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) to reflect goals that I have for the upcoming weeks.

### April 9th, 2024

Formulate a structure by which my project is separated through paths/folders. For example, code that will live inside the Raspberry Pi 5 is restricted to the `/hardware` folder while web app exists within `svelte-app` folder.

### April 10th, 2024

Create files that contain functions that will run on the Raspberry Pi 5 and must interact with data or communicate with ChatGPT according to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation).

### April 11th, 2024

Finish up on prototype scripts and their functions and reorganize them into files within the `manager` folder.

### April 12th, 2024

ChatGPT does not return the required text that is expected. Research whether this is because of the current plan (free) and whether this issue is code related or cash related.

### April 13th, 2024

No progress made due to traveling.

### April 14th, 2024

Make definite decision to use credits to access ChatGPT's 4.0 version which requires payment. This, in theory, should solve problems related to not receiving the tokens/api response.

### Monday April 15th, 2024

Update 2024 SIP website... still requires edits.

### Tuesday April 16th, 2024

Continue updating 2024 SIP website.

### Wednesday April 17th, 2024

Make the switch to an openai assistant rather than chatbot. Allows `threads` and has more support for [instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works).

### Thursday April 18th, 2024

Successfully switch to openai assistant and review docs for how to develop and instruct my own custom assistant (aka the "Storyteller").

### Friday April 19th, 2024

Few optimizations but little progress made.

### Saturday April 20th, 2024

Update website and decide whether or not I am on pace to complete the project. Revelations made: I am technically on pace but hardware incompatibilities in addition to my lacking knowledge of file handling within environments leads me to believe I might have issues in setting up the Raspberry Pi 5.

### Sunday April 21st, 2024

Continue to update website as the deadline is the following day (April 22nd). Make vast improvements within the [scripts folder](project/hardware/manager/scripts) in addition to creating static sound files for a heightened experience with the chat assistant.
