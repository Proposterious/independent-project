# Updates to Project to Satisfy Requirements

## Daily Updates

### April 8th, 2024

Initialize project repository and move, update [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) to reflect goals that I have for the upcoming weeks.

### April 9th, 2024

Formulate a structure by which my project is separated through paths/folders. For example, code that will live inside the Raspberry Pi 5 is restricted to the `/hardware` folder while web app exists within `svelte-app` folder.

### April 10th, 2024

Create files that contain functions that will run on the Raspberry Pi 5 and must interact with data or communicate with ChatGPT according to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation).

### April 11th, 2024

Finish up on prototype scripts and their functions and reorganize them into files within the `manager` folder.

### April 12th, 2024

ChatGPT does not return the required text that is expected. Research whether this is because of the current plan (free) and whether this issue is code related or cash related.

### April 13th, 2024

No progress made due to traveling.

### April 14th, 2024

Make definite decision to use credits to access ChatGPT's 4.0 version which requires payment. This, in theory, should solve problems related to not receiving the tokens/api response.

### Monday April 15th, 2024

Update 2024 SIP website... still requires edits.

### Tuesday April 16th, 2024

Continue updating 2024 SIP website.

### Wednesday April 17th, 2024

Make the switch to an openai assistant rather than chatbot. Allows `threads` and has more support for [instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works).

### Thursday April 18th, 2024

Successfully switch to openai assistant and review docs for how to develop and instruct my own custom assistant (aka the "Storyteller").

### Friday April 19th, 2024

Few optimizations but little progress made.

### Saturday April 20th, 2024

Update website and decide whether or not I am on pace to complete the project. Revelations made: I am technically on pace but hardware incompatibilities in addition to my lacking knowledge of file handling within environments leads me to believe I might have issues in setting up the Raspberry Pi 5.

### Sunday April 21st, 2024

Continue to update website as the deadline is the following day (April 22nd). Make vast improvements within the [scripts folder](project/hardware/manager/scripts) in addition to creating static sound files for a heightened experience with the chat assistant.

### Monday April 22nd, 2024

Completely set up Raspberry Pi 5 with the Raspberry Pi OS, preferred onboard packages, and allow access through VNC (Virtual Network Connection). Research and understand how Raspberry OS (derived from Linux Debian OS) installs/handles commands.

### Tuesday April 23rd, 2024

Brainstorm how to best use the Raspberry Pi 5 when it would be stored inside the robot casing. VNC should handle most of these issues but an additional power source (battery packs) will be required to support motors and such.

### Wednesday April 24th, 2024

Get closer to completing all of the user-robot interaction related scripts in addition to figuring out which features will be excluded from the final product.

### Thursday April 25th, 2024

Decide the best course of action for building the casing of the robot. According to peers, the PIRL contains a 3d printer open for use, I will need to discuss with teachers to get a better understanding of 3d printing. Spent time sketching a detailed design prior to printing as well.

### Friday April 26th, 2024

Discuss with Ms. Wortham about permission to 3d print. Research different avenues for building the doll with the instructions/layout provided by others as building one from scratch isn't feasible.

### Saturday April 27th, 2024

No progress made aka take a rest day.

### Sunday April 28th, 2024

Review past week in preparation for mentor meetings this week. Continue researching the materials needed in order to create a working doll in addition to whether or not it will have movement.

### Monday April 29th, 2024

Discuss with Mr. Goodman next steps and setbacks of my project. Receive advice from Mr. Lanier about building a humanoid robot in which the options appear to be either [InMoov](https://inmoov.fr) or an amalgamation of parts with files provided by [Instructables](https://instructables.com).

### Tuesday April 30th, 2024

Meet with Gavin to discuss progress with the VISoR program. Discuss goals for the week which include 3d printing InMoov's robot head. Come to some conclusion on best steps for replicating human expression through speech in the head and how my project's code will be separated between processing information and interacting with the robot.

### Wednesday May 1st, 2024

Meet with Dr. Wortham to discuss progress on 3d printing head. Reach a compromise where we switch out materials in hopes that the time to print is reduced down to 4 1/2 days instead of 10 days. Continue following tutorials on how to set up circuitry within the robot in preparation.

### Thursday May 2nd, 2024

Attempt to recover time in response to errors with 3d printing. Check in regularly to make sure all goes as planned and ask Ms. Horton to allow use of her 3d printer to make up the time difference. Prepare to buy parts that will be required in addition to the robot head.

### Friday May 3rd, 2024

Abandon 3d printing as the humidity and aging/stress on the machine is messing up the process and delaying the project. Behind progress, reach a compromise where the robot will become something else entirely while still keeping the goals I set at the beginning of the SIP. Send out email to fill in the relevant people on the lack of progress this week.

### Saturday May 4th, 2024

Brainstorm ideas for how to remedy the pains of not having a robot head. Contact the child in hopes of being able to satisfy her requests in terms of the shape and capabilities of the robot turned toy (Jack-in-a-box style). Come up with a basic shape and the hypothetical functionality of a Jack-in-a-box toy.

### Sunday May 5th, 2024

Create an Arduino sketch file containing a basic layout of the code and structure by which the Raspberry Pi will interact with the Arduino board in order to force a Jack-in-a-box motion. Decide that the stepper motor and Stepper motor library provided through Arduino's IDE is the best course of action.

### Monday May 6th, 2024

Meet with Mr. Lanier to go over the practicality of creating a Jack-in-a-box toy within the given time period (7 days). The meeting provided several helpful ideas in addition to feedback regarding the program, the toy itself, and the presentation that will be taking place on May 18th. Assuming I am productive this week, it appears as though the compromise actually enhances the functionality of VISoR rather than hindering it.

### Tuesday May 7th, 2024

Take a "break" (prepare for meeting with SIP advisor Mr. Goodman) prior to continuing with the project. Create a clear understanding of what I should achieve prior to Wednesday May 15th so that time leading up to the deadline is well spent. Reschedule meeting with Gavin to take place Thursday evening.

### Wednesday May 8th, 2024

Meet with Mr. Goodman to explain setbacks, compromises, and a new goal to meet by the May 15th deadline. Discuss options that would best grab the audience's attention so that my project is not too heavily focused on the slideshow presentation but will instead have a good balance. Do some shopping for a USB mini speaker and USB hidden microphone.

### Thursday May 9th, 2024
