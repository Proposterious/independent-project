# Updates to Project to Satisfy Requirements

## Daily Updates

### April 8th, 2024

Initialize project repository and move, update [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) to reflect goals that I have for the upcoming weeks.

### April 9th, 2024

Formulate a structure by which my project is separated through paths/folders. For example, code that will live inside the Raspberry Pi 5 is restricted to the `/hardware` folder while web app exists within `svelte-app` folder.

### April 10th, 2024

Create files that contain functions that will run on the Raspberry Pi 5 and must interact with data or communicate with ChatGPT according to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation).

### April 11th, 2024

Finish up on prototype scripts and their functions and reorganize them into files within the `manager` folder.

### April 12th, 2024

ChatGPT does not return the required text that is expected. Research whether this is because of the current plan (free) and whether this issue is code related or cash related.

### April 13th, 2024

No progress made due to traveling.

### April 14th, 2024

Make definite decision to use credits to access ChatGPT's 4.0 version which requires payment. This, in theory, should solve problems related to not receiving the tokens/api response.
