## Unorganized Notes

### Record Audio to Python File

1. Replicate [How to Record Audio in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE-122yZaCE)
    - `recordSpeech(num: int) -> bool` return `True` or `False` depending on whether or not saving the file succeeded
    - the param `num: int` should start at 1 and go up once per input given by the user during the session
    - Similar to the video, the user should be able to give an input, perhaps a button, that tells the function they are done speaking
2. Create function in its own file to figure out how to use WhisperAI and convert speech
    - `convertSpeech(path: str) -> str` return obj of type str
    - Optional: Watch [How to Convert Speech to Text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbY51mVKrcE)
3. Create function in is own file to delete a file based on a parameter `delFile(path: str) -> bool`
    - Return `True` or `False` depending on whether or not it succeeded
4. Create function in its own file that sends the converted speech as text from <em>Point (2)</em> and send it to ChatGPT using an API key
    - Said "API key" may not yet exist, find out how to retrieve it
