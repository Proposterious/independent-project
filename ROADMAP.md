### Interactive Storytelling Robot (4a)

#### Overview
In this project, we aim to develop an interactive storytelling robot that engages children by narrating stories 
and allowing them to interact with the narrative. The robot will utilize a combination of hardware and software 
technologies to deliver personalized and immersive storytelling experiences.

#### Technologies Required:

- **Robotics Platform**: Select a suitable robotics platform (e.g., Raspberry Pi with motor controllers) to build 
the physical structure of the storytelling robot.
  
- **Speech Synthesis and Recognition**: Integrate speech synthesis for the robot to narrate stories and incorporate 
speech recognition to enable verbal interaction with children.
  
- **Programming Environment**: Develop a programming interface to create and customize interactive storylines 
for the robot, considering user-friendly design principles.
  
- **Machine Learning for Personalization**: Implement machine learning algorithms to personalize the storytelling 
experience based on the child's preferences and engagement levels.
  
- **Sensors for Interaction**: Equip the robot with sensors (e.g., touch sensors) to enable physical interaction 
with children and trigger story events.
  
- **Visual and Audio Elements**: Enhance the storytelling experience with visual and audio elements such as animated 
displays, LED lights, and sound effects.
  
- **Power Supply and Durability**: Ensure the robot has a reliable power supply and design it with durability 
to withstand interaction with children.
  
- **Safety Features**: Implement safety features to protect children from potential hazards associated with 
interacting with the robot.

### Interactive Art Installation (8b)

#### Overview
This project involves creating an interactive art installation that responds to viewers' emotional expressions 
in real-time, using facial recognition technology and dynamic visual elements. The installation aims to engage 
viewers by reflecting their emotions through visual transformations.

#### Technologies Required:

- **Facial Recognition Software**: Utilize facial recognition algorithms to detect and analyze viewers' emotional 
expressions captured by a camera or webcam.
  
- **Camera or Webcam**: Install a camera or webcam to capture live video footage of viewers' faces for facial 
recognition.
  
- **Microcontroller or Single Board Computer**: Use a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) or a single-board computer 
(e.g., Raspberry Pi) to process facial recognition data and control visual elements.
  
- **LED Lights, Projectors, or Display Panels**: Implement visual elements (e.g., LED lights, projectors) that 
change in response to detected emotions, creating dynamic visual effects.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train machine learning models to recognize a range of emotions from facial expressions, 
using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  
- **Communication Protocols**: Set up communication protocols between the facial recognition system and hardware 
controlling visual elements (e.g., serial communication, network protocols).
  
- **Power Supply**: Ensure the art installation has a reliable power supply to operate continuously, considering 
power requirements of all components.
  
- **Enclosure and Mounting Hardware**: Design an enclosure to house hardware components and provide mounting hardware 
for camera, lights, and other elements, considering durability and aesthetics.
